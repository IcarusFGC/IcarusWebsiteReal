                <p>The primary goal of ICARUS is to offer a detailed ELO-based ladder that players and potential sponsors can rely on. We collect data weekly from major tournaments, whether it's a Major, a regional, or a significant online event. This data is processed through our ELO calculator and then displayed on our comprehensive leaderboard for everyone to view. Additionally, each week, we host an episode of "Run It Back," a thorough recap of the week’s highlights, covering everything from exhilarating combos to stunning upsets.
